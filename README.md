# Terms-and-definitions-Appium

I found a lot of definitions and terms about Selenium Webdriver, TestNG and Appium on the Internet, but not all of them were understandable to me as a beginner. It took a time to find ones that would be explained simply and clearly. Therefore, I created this repository to have all the definitions in one place so that I could check them if necessary. The definitions are not mine, they were all found on the Internet.

## Terms and definitions of Appium

### 1. Appium definition
   
Appium is an open-source, cross-platform automation tool for testing mobile applications. It allows developers to automate the testing of both Android and iOS apps. Appium supports native, hybrid, and mobile web applications, and it is designed to be platform-agnostic, which means that the same test scripts can be used across multiple platforms.

I will keep adding information....
