# Terms-and-definitions-Appium

I found a lot of definitions and terms about Selenium Webdriver, TestNG and Appium on the Internet, but not all of them were understandable to me as a beginner. It took a time to find ones that would be explained simply and clearly. Therefore, I created this repository to have all the definitions in one place so that I could check them if necessary. The definitions are not mine, they were all found on the Internet.

## Terms and definitions of Appium

### 1. Appium definition
   
Appium is an open-source, cross-platform automation tool for testing mobile applications. It allows developers to automate the testing of both Android and iOS apps. Appium supports native, hybrid, and mobile web applications, and it is designed to be platform-agnostic, which means that the same test scripts can be used across multiple platforms.

### 2. Main differences between Appium and Selenium Webdriver

  - Appium is designed for automating mobile applications (both Android and iOS), while Selenium WebDriver is primarily used for automating web browsers;

  - Appium requires a server to interact with mobile devices, while Selenium directly interacts with web browsers;

  - Appium requires a mobile device or emulator/simulator to run tests, whereas Selenium WebDriver only requires a web browser for test execution;

  - Appium allows for gestures and touch actions (like swipe, pinch, and scroll) on mobile devices, whereas Selenium focuses on mouse and keyboard actions in web browsers;

  - Appium requires the use of specific mobile drivers (like UiAutomator for Android or XCUITest for iOS) to interact with mobile apps, while Selenium uses browser drivers (like 
    ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver) to interact with web browsers;

  - Another difference is that Appium requires the installation of mobile development tools like Android SDK or Xcode to interact with mobile devices, while Selenium only requires the 
    installation of a web driver for browser automation.



I will keep adding information....
